Code for our ESP8266 desk occupancy devices.

Barnsley Council has aspirations to mobilise it's workforce, allowing them the freedom and flexibility to work from anywhere - home, coffee shop, caravan, anywhere that a connection with the corporate VPN can be achieved.

The theory goes that even without this, the council's buildings and office spaces are rarely fully occupied. Sickness, annual leave, site visits, conferences, all go some way to meaning that there are reguarly empty desks. Desks cost money. Lighting, heating, power, etc.

In mobilising it's workforce the council gains the opportunity to draw savings from using it's office provisions more effectively. Having non-assigned desks means staff can sit at any available desks when they're in.

This code is for a device that we intend to sit on every desk such that staff can indicate by pressing a button when they've occupied a desk. They can also indicate when they've finished with it by pressing another button. The status of all desks is held centrally and staff can use their mobiles to find available desks before they arrive, or using screens as they arrive in the building lobby.
